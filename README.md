## This is my .vimrc 
but can be yours too!!!

Please access [My vimrc](https://duarch.github.io/myvimirc/) website.

I'm gonna explain in the easy way, how each one of vim plugins I selected will help you (or not).

You copy only the part of vimrc file do you want. Or copy the entire file and remove each part as long you decide it's not useful.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/duarch/myvimirc/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/duarch/myvimirc/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
